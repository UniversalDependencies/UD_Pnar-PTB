# Summary

UD Pnar-PTB is a conversion from the Ring (2017) dataset ([doi:10.21979/N9/KVFGBZ](http://dx.doi.org/10.21979/N9/KVFGBZ)) that underpins a grammatical description of the Pnar language (Ring 2015, [http://hdl.handle.net/10356/62519](http://hdl.handle.net/10356/62519)). The corpus consists of folktales and interviews transcribed, translated, and interlinearized.

# Introduction

# Acknowledgments

The conversion has been done primarily by Hiram Ring at University of Zurich, but interested parties are welcome to contribute.
